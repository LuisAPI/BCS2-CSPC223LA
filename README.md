## About this repository

All activities done for laboratory sessions for the subject “Programming Languages” (codes: CSPC223 and CSPC223LA) are uploaded here for archival purposes.

Additionally, this repo can serve as a guide for future generations of students at De La Salle University–Dasmariñas, as to what to expect and what kinds of homework our instructor, Mr. Orlando Zapanta, will hand out to us.

This repository is maintained by Luis Anton P. Imperial, second-year BS Computer Science student at DLSU-D.

## What outputs are included in this repository?

### Midterm period outputs

**Information display script.** The first onsite recitation presented my name and date of birth in various ways.

**Module 1 Quiz.** Our class was tested on the fundamentals of programming and its different forms and applications.

**Module 1 Test.** We instilled in ourselves the basics of the JavaScript programming language and concepts regarding the construction of websites and web applications.

**Contacts on the terminal.** Important personally-identifying information such as names, mobile phone numbers, and e-mail addresses are a core part of what makes us human. This script displays five predetermined information in a neatly-organized table.

**Type encapsulation and manipulation script.** Understanding different types, such as Booleans, strings, integers and big numbers, are key to storing data in an efficient manner. We did multiple experiment to figure out their malleability and suitability for the applications we desired.

**Module 2 Test.** We instilled in ourselves important JavaScript and general programming concepts, like types, global and local variables, and string directives for the interpreter.

**Repetition of input requests.** Constant retrieval of new data is important to ensuring the relevance of the tools we write. Our fifth week of class had us insert a series of data blocks through the use of a common loop function.

**Module 3 Test.** The class trawled back to past lessons regarding the acceptance of data elements in a repeated manner, and put our skills to the test.

**Market inventory management.** Our last practical activity for the midterm period assigned us to the creation of a system to manage the inventory of a storefront for fast-moving consumer goods. We were given two predetermined items to start with — a branded chocolate spread and a type of sweets — and were tasked to present the addition of twice more products.

**Module 4 Quiz.** Ending the first two and a half months of grind, sweat and hard work, our culminating enabling assessment was held just after the Holy Week break, providing enough time to prepare for this scheduled deliverable.

### Final period outputs

**Academic grading system.** We created a script to represent our final result for the semester based on input values, alongside percentages and formulas provided by our instructor and our university’s website.

**Numerical analysis tool.** Understanding the values we have makes us more in touch with the world around us. This document’s series of pop-ups accepts inputs of the Number type and provides a statistic the user may find helpful.

**Module 5 Test.** Knowing more about ourselves as future computer scientists starts with an aptitude of the excellence we have in this field. This serves as our penultimate activity for the final term.

**Module 6 Test.** And I did it again — a perfect score in a Cisco NetAcad LMS quiz. With faith and passion, everything is possible.

The semester ended with an almighty 4.00 out of 4.00 grade point average in this subject.
